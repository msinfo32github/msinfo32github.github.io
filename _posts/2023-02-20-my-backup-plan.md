# Follow 3-2-1

Question: ***How do you make sure you never lose data?***

Following the 3-2-1 backup plan!

## But what is 3-2-1?

3-2-1 is the idea to have:

- 3 copies of your data
- 2 different media types (such as using LTO tape as well as HDDs!)
- 1 copy of your data offsite (such as away from other copies, or in the "cloud" using services such as [Hetzner Storage Box](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box) or [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/))
